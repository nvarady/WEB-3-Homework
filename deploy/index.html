                                                    <p>The steel in our saw's blade is the best that's available. It is very hard (50-52R) and will stay sharp a long time. Eventually, however, you'll have to sharpen it. You can do this easily yourself with a little practice. We use a 5" double extra slim taper file to file the teeth on our Carcass and Dovetail Saws, and you can do the same if you're skilled at filing. If not, start with a smaller 4" extra slim taper file, which will make it easier to line up the file with the gullet for beginning filers.
                                                     <br>
                                                    It is a good idea to keep a coat of oil or silicon spray on your saw's blade when not in use. This will minimize the chance of rust forming on the blade.</p>

                                                <p>You will find that your saw is a joy to use. Unlike most saws on the market, every Lie-Nielsen saw has been precision set, filed, and test cut in hardwood before it leaves the shop.
                                                The first thing you’ll need to know about your saw is how to hold it. The proper grip is to wrap the middle, ring, and little fingers around the handle with the forefinger pointing along the Brass back. You’ll discover that in doing so, you will have much better control over how your saw tracks, and it will also feel very comfortable and natural.
